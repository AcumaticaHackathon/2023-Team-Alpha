# Acumatica Rewards
Acumatica Rewards
Get rewarded for using Acumatica! Complete surveys, follow up training by completing tests, and just do your job in Acumatica to earn points. Earn enough points, and you can cash in on rewards provided by the company. If you are lucky, maybe your company will even let you redeem points for an extra day of paid leave!

# Background
Few people like taking the annual safety training, and even fewer like taking tests to confirm competency after training. Feedback is a gift, but suggestions turn into complaints and then disappear as employees disengage. Human psychology drives people to gain pleasure, avoid pain, and reduce effort. Let's face it. Training and testing tends to be a PAIN! With Acumatica Rewards, you can achieve your training goals and garner valuable feedback by REWARDING EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT.
